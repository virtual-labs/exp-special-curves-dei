      "question": "The angle subtended at the centre of the directing circle is calculated by the formula ____.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "(r/R) × 180° ",
        "b": "(R/r) × 360°",
        "c": "(r/R) × 360°",
        "d": "(R/r) × 180°"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanation": "The angle subtended = (R/r) × 180° for a rolling circle tracing a hypocycloid or epicycloid.",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "The arch length of a cycloid is how many times the radius of a circle generating the cycloid?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "4",
        "b": "8",
        "c": "2",
        "d": "Equal"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "The arc length of one complete cycloid is approximately 8 times the radius of the generating circle.",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "Gear tooth is a combination of hypocycloid and epicycloid.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "True",
        "b": "False "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanation": "Gear teeth profiles often use hypocycloid for flanks and epicycloid for faces.",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "If the diameter of the directing circle is doubled the diameter of the generating circle then the hypocycloid will become a ______.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Point",
        "b": "Line",
        "c": "Epicycloid ",
        "d": "None of the above "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "When the directing circle’s diameter is twice the generating circle’s, the hypocycloid becomes a straight line.",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "A circle of 30 mm diameter rolls outside another circle of diameter 150 mm. The angle subtended at the centre of directing circle is _____",
      "answers": {
        "a": "56°",
        "b": "85°",
        "c": "72°",
        "d": "90"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "Angle = (d/D) × 360° = (30/150) × 360 = 72°.",
      "difficulty": "advanced"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following curve will be generated if a circle of diameter 40 mm rolls on the circumference of another circle of diameter 150 mm and outside it?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Cycloid ",
        "b": "Epicycloid ",
        "c": "Hypocycloid ",
        "d": "None of the above "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "When a circle rolls outside another circle’s circumference, it generates an epicycloid.",
