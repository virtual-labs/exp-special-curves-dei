      "question": "The angle subtended at the centre of the directing circle is calculated by the formula ____.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "(r/R) × 180° ",
        "b": "(R/r) × 360°",
        "c": "(r/R) × 360°",
        "d": "(R/r) × 180°"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "d": "The angle subtended = (R/r) × 180° for a rolling circle tracing a hypocycloid or epicycloid."

        "a": "True",
        "b": "False "
      },
      "explanations": {

      "question": "If the diameter of the directing circle is doubled the diameter of the generating circle then the hypocycloid will become a ______.",

        "c": "Epicycloid ",
        "d": "Circle"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "When the directing circle’s diameter is twice the generating circle’s, the hypocycloid becomes a straight line."

      "question": "A circle of 30 mm diameter rolls outside another circle of diameter 150 mm. The angle subtended at the centre of directing circle is _____",
